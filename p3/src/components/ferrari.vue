            Because Pirelli were world leaders in crossply sports car tires in the vintage years of front
            engined
            Ferrari road cars and race cars, Ferrari’s Association with fitting Pirelli Stella Bianca and
            Stelvio
            tyres was deeply engrained. Of course Being Italian and having such a good relationship with the
            vintage
            wire wheel builder Ruote Borrani Milano only strengthened these connections.

            In 1952 when the introduction of the radial Cinturato CA67 moved forward the performance expected
            from a
            sports car tyre. Immediately road races were being won on these new outstanding progressive radial
            tyres. As a result by 1960 pretty much every Ferrari Road car was leaving Maranello fitted with
            either a
            185VR16 Cinturato CA67 or a 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CA67.

            The next massive leap forward came in 1964 when Pirelli developed the Cinturato CN72 tyre which was
            able
            to be produced in the size 205, which was the first time a tyre this size was able to be fitted to
            cars
            as fast as these Vintage Ferrari.

            At the End of the ‘60s low profile tyres became available, with tyres like the Cinturato CN36 and
            CN12.
            Of course it didn’t take long before tyres got lower and lower in profile which led to the
            development
            of the fabulous Pirelli Cinturato P7.
