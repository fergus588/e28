    <h1>Classic Alfa Tyres</h1>
    <p>There is a theory that modern tyres are better than old style tyres. In a way that is correct. A
        modern tyre fitted to a modern car, that has been developed to take advantage of what a modern
        tyre
        carcass has to offer will give considerably more grip than an old style tyre could ever offer,
        because the 2 components; the tyre and the car complement each other.</p>
    <p>That does not mean that an old car, which doesn’t have lots of caster and adverse camber, will
        have
        its handling improved by fitting a modern style tyre carcass, that is not suited to its steering
        and
        suspension set up. If you dramatically modify your classic Alfa to suit modern tyres then yes
        you
        may be able to get more grip, but it will change the handling characteristics of these sporty,
        fun,
        light, progressive cars.</p>
    <p>Alfa Romeo didn’t just draw a tyre size out of a hat, or just fit 165R14 tyres because they were
        cheap. If price was their major determining factor they wouldn’t have fitted the Pirelli
        Cinturato.
        They continued to fit 165R14 tyres to their rear wheel drive sports cars 15 years after the
        option
        to fit a wider low profile tyre was available, because they handled better on these thinner
        tyres.
    </p>
    <p>However when considering driving an old car on a modern road, you might think you want more grip.
        The
        concern is that modern cars can stop so quickly with their anti-lock braking systems. It is
        reassuring to know that today’s classic Alfa Romeo tyres from Pirelli, arguably one of the
        world’s
        best tyre manufacturers, are using modern quality control systems to provide you with a product
        that
        won’t let you down. Pirelli’s Cinturato range of classic tyres are built with up to date modern
        compounds developed to move water quicker than they ever could in the past, and provide the best
        possible levels of grip from the relatively small foot print that Alfa Romeo, through all their
        testing, knew was the best size tyre for their cars . </p>
